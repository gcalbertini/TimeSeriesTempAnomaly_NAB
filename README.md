### Anomaly Detection using Time Series Data - [Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB) Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/boltzmannbrain/nab)

Data considered:
https://github.com/numenta/NAB/blob/master/data/realKnownCause/ambient_temperature_system_failure.csv

A quick project to explore data, to demonstrate feature engineering and to develop a statistical anomaly detection model which identifies anomalies in the recorded temperature of 
sensor temperature readings. See Jupyter notebook for walkthrough and project considerations and contraints!
